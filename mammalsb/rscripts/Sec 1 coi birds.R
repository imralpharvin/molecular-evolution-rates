# Trim sequences with high N and gap content at their terminal ends.
# Find sequences that begin (^) with an N or a gap and split them using tstrsplit. Take only the second half of the split.
# strsplit gives a blank first element here when splitting at the beginning of the string, so that is why the chained

# Here, we are obtaining information on a per BIN basis to facilitate trait matching later on.

### FILTER 7 ###
# Remove rows with no species information. This will remove BINs without any species information. BINs without species data

# EXAMPLE: the following line would remove a specific record from the dataframe.
# dfResolve <- ResolveBIN(dfResolve, 8464523, method = "recordID")
# EXAMPLE: Or you can remove an entire BIN from the dataset. You may want to do this if
# there is no clear consensus in the BIN for an order level assignment.
