##### SECTION 3: CENTROID SEQUENCE DETERMINATION #####
# This section is designed to select a centroid sequence for each BIN. A centroid sequence is the sequence in a BIN with minimum sum of pairwise
# distance to all other sequences in the BIN. It will serve as a representative sequence for the BIN/species.
